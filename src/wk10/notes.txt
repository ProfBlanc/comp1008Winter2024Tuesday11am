Inheritance
    Creating a class based on another class
    SuperHero   a Human with extra features
    A head start, where you can USE features of existing classes
    What can you use/what is accessible?
        instance variables
        methods
            normal
            constructors
                * only default constructor is inherited
        constants
        * all non-private

    Note that you cannot remove any entites
    Private entites are not accessible. They may be accessible via
    public wrappers/methods

In java all classes inherit from the base data type class
Object


Create a class named Animal
    instance variables
        name, legs, color, species
    constructors: 2: default + 4-args
    method: isScary: yes if more than 4 legs
    override to toString to summarize all 4 instance variables

Create a Cat based on Animal
    new instance variables of
        weight, whiskers
    constructors: 3: 2 constructors of Animal + constructor that accepts 6 args
    method: isScary is overridden: weight > 300 pounds
    override to toString to summarize all 6 instance variables
